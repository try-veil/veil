# Utility Functions

- Use lodash utilities for common operations (arrays, objects, strings)
- Import specific lodash functions to minimize bundle size:
  ```typescript
  import groupBy from "lodash/groupBy";
  ```
- Create utility functions in `utils/` folder for reusable logic
- The `utils` folder also contains core app logic such as Next.js Server Actions and Gmail API requests.
