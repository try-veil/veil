# Reply Tracker

Reply Tracker (also known as Reply Zero) lets the user which emails need a reply for them and those they're awaiting a reply on.
It updates the labels for the thread automatically in Gmail.

The database models and fields that are used for this feature:

- ThreadTracker
- User.outboundReplyTracking
- ActionType.TRACK_THREAD

The system uses rules. The AI can choose which rule to use each time an email comes in. Rules are for incoming emails only. Not ongoing.
When enabling the reply tracker, we create a rule for the user that has the following actions associated with it:
- LABEL: "To Reply"
- TRACK_THREAD
- DRAFT_EMAIL (optional)

We'll draft a reply for the user automatically if DRAFT_EMAIL is set. The draft will be generated using the email history for this sender as well as the Knowledge base. See `.cursor/rules/features/knowledge.mdc` for more on the Knowledge Base feature.

Enabling `User.outboundReplyTracking` means that when a user sends an email, we'll run an LLM over the email and check if it needs a reply. If it does we'll mark it as Awaiting Reply.
