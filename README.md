# Veil - Opinionated Caddy Module

Veil is a Caddy module that provides API management capabilities, including subscription-based access control and request validation. It acts as a middleware that validates API requests based on subscription levels and required headers.

Disclaimer: üöß ‚ö†Ô∏è This is a heavily under development and the API is subject to change.

## Demo

Below is a small recording of the terminal we onboard the [Dummy JSON](https://dummyjson.com/todos) API and put it behind veil.
