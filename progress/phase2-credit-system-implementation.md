# Phase 2: Credit Management System - Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive credit management system in the PAX service that handles user credit balances, transactions, reservations, and integrates with the existing Razorpay payment system.

## Goals
1. Accurate credit balance tracking with full audit trail
2. Reservation system for in-flight API requests (prevents overdrafts)
3. Credit purchase via Razorpay integration
4. Transaction-safe operations (no race conditions)
5. Low balance notifications
6. Admin credit management tools

    - Update purchase status to 'completed'
    - Link creditTransactionId
  - `failPurchase(purchaseUid, reason)`
  - `getPurchases(userId)`
  - `getPurchase(uid)`

### Step 5: API Routes ⏳

#### Credit Account Routes (`src/routes/credits/accounts.ts`)
- [ ] `GET /api/v1/credits/account` - Get account details
- [ ] `GET /api/v1/credits/balance` - Get balance (simplified)
- [ ] `PUT /api/v1/credits/account/settings` - Update settings

### Step 6: Payment Integration ⏳
- [ ] Update `payment-service.ts` to call credit service on successful payment
- [ ] Modify webhook handler to trigger credit purchase completion
- [ ] Add webhook event type: `payment.completed` → `completePurchase()`
- [ ] Ensure idempotency (check if credits already added for payment)

### Step 7: Background Jobs ⏳
- [ ] Create `src/jobs/cleanup-expired-reservations.ts`
  - Run every 1 minute
  - Call `CreditReservationService.cleanupExpiredReservations()`
- [ ] Create `src/jobs/check-auto-recharge.ts` (optional for v1)

  - Used by proxy routes
- [ ] Update auth middleware to optionally load credit balance
- [ ] Create admin auth middleware for admin routes

### Step 9: Testing ⏳
- [ ] Unit tests for repositories
- [ ] Unit tests for services (especially transaction safety)
- [ ] Integration test: Purchase flow end-to-end
  - Create payment → Complete payment → Credits added
- [ ] Integration test: Reservation flow
  - Reserve → Settle with exact amount
  - Reserve → Settle with less (release difference)
  - Reserve → Release (cancel)
  - Reserve → Expire → Auto-release
- [ ] Concurrent transaction test
  - Multiple simultaneous deductions
  - Verify no race conditions
  - Verify balance integrity
- [ ] Load test: 100 concurrent reservations

### Step 10: Documentation ⏳
- [ ] Update Swagger docs with new endpoints
- [ ] Add examples for credit purchase flow
- [ ] Document reservation flow for proxy integration
- [ ] Update README with credit system usage
- [ ] Add environment variables to `.env.example`

### Step 11: Integration & Validation ⏳
- [ ] Start PAX service: `bun run dev`
- [ ] Test account creation
- [ ] Test credit package management
- [ ] Test credit purchase flow (with test Razorpay)
- [ ] Test reservation → settle flow
- [ ] Test reservation → release flow
- [ ] Test concurrent operations
- [ ] Verify webhook integration
- [ ] Check database constraints work
- [ ] Verify no negative balances possible

## Key Technical Decisions

### Transaction Safety
- Use PostgreSQL row-level locking (`FOR UPDATE`) for all balance operations
- Wrap all balance changes in database transactions
- Add check constraints at DB level (balance >= 0)
- Idempotency keys for credit additions from payments

### Credit-to-Currency Rate
- Default: 1 INR = 1 credit
- Configurable in future via config table
- Store in decimal(12,4) for precision

### Reservation Expiry
- Default: 5 minutes
- Configurable per operation
- Background job runs every 1 minute to cleanup

### Error Handling
- Insufficient balance: HTTP 402 Payment Required
- Suspended account: HTTP 403 Forbidden
- Invalid reservation: HTTP 404 Not Found
- Concurrent modification: Retry with exponential backoff

## Database Transaction Example

```typescript
// Reserve credits with proper locking
async reserveCredits(userId: number, amount: number, ...): Promise<Reservation> {
  return await db.transaction(async (tx) => {
    // Lock account row
    const account = await tx.select()
      .from(creditAccounts)
      .where(eq(creditAccounts.userId, userId))
      .for('update')
      .then(rows => rows[0]);

    // Check balance
    if (account.balance < amount) {
      throw new InsufficientBalanceError();
    }

    // Update balances
    await tx.update(creditAccounts)
      .set({
        balance: sql`${creditAccounts.balance} - ${amount}`,
        reservedBalance: sql`${creditAccounts.reservedBalance} + ${amount}`
      })
      .where(eq(creditAccounts.id, account.id));

    // Create transaction record
    const txRecord = await tx.insert(creditTransactions).values({
      type: 'reserve',
      amount,
      balanceBefore: account.balance,
      balanceAfter: account.balance - amount,
      ...
    }).returning();

    // Create reservation
    const reservation = await tx.insert(creditReservations).values({
      amount,
      transactionId: txRecord.id,
      expiresAt: new Date(Date.now() + expiresInMinutes * 60000),
      ...
    }).returning();

    return reservation;
  });
}
```

## API Flow Examples

### Purchase Credits Flow
```
1. GET /api/v1/credits/packages
   → Returns available packages

2. POST /api/v1/credits/purchase
   Body: { packageUid: "pkg_xxx" }
   → Creates purchase record
   → Creates Razorpay order
   → Returns { purchaseUid, orderId, amount }

3. [User completes payment on Razorpay]

4. Webhook: POST /api/v1/webhooks/razorpay
   Event: payment.captured
   → Calls completePurchase(purchaseUid, paymentUid)
   → Adds credits to account
   → Marks purchase as completed

5. GET /api/v1/credits/balance
   → Shows updated balance
```

### Proxy Request with Credit Reservation
```
1. POST /internal/v1/credits/reserve
   Body: { userId, amount: 0.5, purpose: "proxy_request", referenceId: "req_xxx" }
   → Reserves 0.5 credits
   → Returns { reservationUid }

2. [Process proxy request]

3. POST /internal/v1/credits/settle/{reservationUid}
   Body: { actualAmount: 0.35 }
   → Deducts 0.35 from reserved
   → Releases 0.15 back to balance
   → Creates usage record
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Can create credit accounts
- [ ] Can purchase credits via Razorpay
- [ ] Credits appear in account after payment
- [ ] Can reserve credits without race conditions
- [ ] Can settle reservations with partial amounts
- [ ] Expired reservations auto-release
- [ ] No negative balances possible
- [ ] Transaction history is complete and accurate
- [ ] 100+ concurrent operations handled safely
- [ ] Webhook integration works for credit additions

## Edge Cases to Handle

1. **Double crediting from webhook**: Use payment transaction UID as idempotency key
2. **Concurrent reservations**: Row-level locking prevents overdrafts
3. **Reservation expiry during settlement**: Check status before settling
4. **Negative balances**: DB constraints prevent, application validates
5. **Suspended account operations**: Check status before all operations
6. **Failed payment after purchase creation**: Mark purchase as failed
7. **Partial refunds**: Support in credit transaction service
8. **Admin adjustments**: Separate transaction type with admin user tracking

## Dependencies

- Existing `payment-service.ts` and `razorpay-provider.ts`
- PostgreSQL with transaction support
- Drizzle ORM with transaction API
- JWT auth middleware

## Estimated Complexity

**High** - Financial system with strict accuracy requirements

## Estimated Time

- Database & Types: 2 hours
- Repositories: 3 hours
- Services: 4 hours
- API Routes: 3 hours
- Payment Integration: 2 hours
- Background Jobs: 1 hour
- Testing: 3 hours
- Documentation: 1 hour

**Total: ~19 hours (2-3 days)**

## Notes

- This is a financial system - accuracy is critical
- All money operations must be within DB transactions
- Comprehensive audit trail required
- No shortcuts on validation or error handling
- Test concurrent operations thoroughly
