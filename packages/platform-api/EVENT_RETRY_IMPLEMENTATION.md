# Event Retry System Implementation

## Overview

Implemented a comprehensive event queue system with automatic retry mechanism for reliable event processing in the Veil platform API.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Event Queue Core (`src/utils/event-queue.ts`)

**Features:**
- **Automatic Retries**: Exponential backoff with configurable max attempts
- **Priority Queuing**: High, normal, and low priority events
- **Dead Letter Queue**: Failed events moved for manual review
- **Event Persistence**: All events stored in PostgreSQL
- **Idempotency**: Prevents duplicate processing
- **Timeout Handling**: Configurable timeouts per operation
- **Background Processing**: Continuous polling with configurable interval

**Key Methods:**
- `enqueue(type, payload, options)` - Add event to queue
- `start()` - Start background processor
- `stop()` - Stop processing
- `getStats()` - Get queue statistics
- `getDeadLetterEvents()` - Retrieve failed events
- `retryDeadLetterEvent(id)` - Retry a failed event
- `cleanup(olderThanDays)` - Remove old completed events

**Default Configuration:**
- Poll interval: 1000ms (1 second)
- Max retries: 5 attempts
- Base retry delay: 1000ms
- Exponential backoff: delay × 2^(attempt-1)
- Timeout: 30000ms (30 seconds)

### 2. Database Schema (`src/db/schema.ts`)

**event_queue Table:**
```typescript
{
  id: serial (primary key)
  type: varchar(100) - Event type identifier
  payload: text - JSON payload
  priority: varchar(20) - 'high', 'normal', 'low'
  status: varchar(20) - 'pending', 'processing', 'completed', 'failed', 'dead_letter'
  attempts: integer - Current attempt count
  maxAttempts: integer - Maximum retry attempts
  nextRetryAt: timestamp - When to retry next
  error: text - Last error message
  createdAt: timestamp
  updatedAt: timestamp
  processedAt: timestamp
}
```

**Indexes:**
- `type` - Fast lookup by event type
- `status` - Filter by status
- `priority` - Priority ordering
- `nextRetryAt` - Efficient polling for ready events
- `createdAt` - Chronological ordering
- `status, nextRetryAt` - Composite index for polling query

### 3. Event Handlers (`src/services/event-handlers.ts`)

**Registered Handlers:**

1. **usage_tracking** (High Priority)
   - Processes usage events with 5 max attempts
   - 2 second base retry delay
   - Updates billing period usage data

2. **subscription_created** (High Priority)
   - Sends welcome emails
   - 3 max attempts
   - 3 second base retry delay

3. **payment_processing** (High Priority)
   - Processes payments asynchronously
   - 5 max attempts
   - 5 second base retry delay

4. **invoice_generation** (Normal Priority)
   - Generates invoices
   - 3 max attempts
   - 2 second base retry delay

5. **quota_warning** (Normal Priority)
   - Sends quota warning notifications
   - 3 max attempts
   - 1 second base retry delay

6. **api_sync** (High Priority)
   - Syncs API config with gateway
   - 5 max attempts
   - 3 second base retry delay

7. **webhook_delivery** (Low Priority)
   - Delivers webhooks to external systems
   - 5 max attempts
   - 5 second base retry delay

### 4. Usage Tracking Integration (`src/services/usage-tracking-service.ts`)

**New Method:**
```typescript
async trackUsage(subscriptionId, usageIncrement) {
  // Enqueues usage event for reliable processing
  await eventQueue.enqueue('usage_tracking', usageEvent, {
    priority: 'high',
    maxAttempts: 5
  });
}
```

**Fallback:**
- If enqueue fails, falls back to direct update
- Ensures usage tracking never fails silently

### 5. Admin Monitoring Routes (`src/routes/events.ts`)

**Endpoints:**

- `GET /api/v1/events/stats`
  - Returns queue statistics (pending, processing, completed, failed, dead letter counts)

- `GET /api/v1/events/dead-letter?limit=100`
  - Retrieves failed events needing manual intervention

- `POST /api/v1/events/dead-letter/:eventId/retry`
  - Requeues a failed event for retry

- `DELETE /api/v1/events/cleanup?olderThanDays=7`
  - Deletes old completed events to save space

### 6. Server Integration (`src/index.ts`)

**Startup:**
- Event queue starts after pricing service initialization
- All handlers registered automatically
- Background processor begins polling immediately

**Shutdown:**
- Graceful shutdown on SIGINT/SIGTERM
- Event queue stops before server shutdown
- In-flight events complete before exit

## Retry Logic

### Exponential Backoff

For each retry, the delay increases exponentially:

```
Attempt 1: baseDelay × 2^0 = baseDelay
Attempt 2: baseDelay × 2^1 = 2 × baseDelay
Attempt 3: baseDelay × 2^2 = 4 × baseDelay
Attempt 4: baseDelay × 2^3 = 8 × baseDelay
Attempt 5: baseDelay × 2^4 = 16 × baseDelay
```

**Example (baseDelay = 1000ms):**
- Attempt 1: Retry after 1 second
- Attempt 2: Retry after 2 seconds
- Attempt 3: Retry after 4 seconds
- Attempt 4: Retry after 8 seconds
- Attempt 5: Retry after 16 seconds

### Dead Letter Queue

Events that fail after maximum attempts are moved to dead letter queue:
- Status set to `dead_letter`
- Error message preserved
- Available for manual review via API
- Can be manually retried (resets attempt count)

## Idempotency

### Idempotency Manager

```typescript
class IdempotencyManager {
  - check(key): Returns cached result if operation was already performed
  - store(key, result): Stores operation result with timestamp
  - cleanup(): Removes expired entries (default TTL: 1 hour)
}
```

**Usage in Two-Phase Commit:**
```typescript
const idempotencyKey = `api-create-${sellerId}-${data.name}-${Date.now()}`;
const cached = await idempotencyManager.check(idempotencyKey);
if (cached) return cached;

// Perform operation...

await idempotencyManager.store(idempotencyKey, result);
```

## Database Migration

**Migration File:** `drizzle/0003_new_santa_claus.sql`

Applied to: `veil-postgres` container (PostgreSQL 16) on port 5433

## Testing

### Event Queue Stats
```bash
curl http://localhost:3010/api/v1/events/stats
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "pending": 0,
    "processing": 0,
    "completed": 0,
    "failed": 0,
    "deadLetter": 0
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

### Retry Flow
```
Event Created → Pending
     ↓
Processing (attempt 1)
     ↓
Error → Schedule Retry (exponential backoff)
     ↓
Processing (attempt 2)
     ↓
Error → Schedule Retry (longer delay)
     ↓
... (continue until maxAttempts)
     ↓
Max Attempts Reached → Dead Letter Queue
```

### Rollback on Failure

Two-phase commit ensures rollback if any phase fails:

```typescript
try {
  // Phase 1: Prepare - Database
  const api = await createAPI();

  // Phase 2: Commit - Gateway
  await registerWithGateway(api);

  return success;
} catch (error) {
  // Rollback all prepared phases
  await deleteAPI(api.id);
  throw error;
}
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Polling Efficiency
- Batch processing: 10 events per poll cycle
- `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`: Prevents lock contention
- Priority ordering: High → Normal → Low
- Index-optimized query: `status = 'pending' AND nextRetryAt <= NOW()`

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling: Multiple server instances can poll concurrently
- No lock conflicts due to `SKIP LOCKED`
- Database-backed: Survives server restarts
- Automatic cleanup: Prevents unbounded growth

### Resource Usage
- Poll interval: 1 second (configurable)
- Batch size: 10 events (configurable)
- Cleanup interval: 5 minutes for idempotency cache
- Default TTL: 7 days for completed events

## Future Enhancements

1. **Priority Lanes**: Separate queues per priority level
2. **Circuit Breaker**: Temporarily disable handlers with high failure rates
3. **Metrics**: Prometheus metrics for monitoring
4. **Distributed Locks**: Redis-based locks for multi-instance deployments
5. **Event Replay**: Ability to replay events from specific timestamp
6. **DLQ Alerts**: Slack/email notifications for dead letter events
7. **Rate Limiting**: Per-handler rate limits to prevent overload

## Integration Points

- ✅ Usage tracking (high priority, 5 attempts)
- ⏳ Subscription creation (placeholder)
- ⏳ Payment processing (placeholder)
- ⏳ Invoice generation (placeholder)
- ⏳ Quota warnings (placeholder)
