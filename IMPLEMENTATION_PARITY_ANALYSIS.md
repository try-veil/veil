## 5. Background Jobs

### ✅ IMPLEMENTED (4 jobs)

| Job | Schedule | Purpose | Status |
|-----|----------|---------|--------|
| `billing-period-closure` | Every 6 hours | Close expired billing periods | ✅ Implemented |
| `invoice-reminder` | Daily | Send payment reminders | ✅ Implemented |
| `promotion-cleanup` | Daily | Deactivate expired promotions | ✅ Implemented |
| Job Scheduler | - | Simple cron-like scheduler | ✅ Implemented |

### ❌ MISSING JOBS

Critical jobs documented but not implemented:

1. **Gateway Sync Jobs** 🔴 CRITICAL
   - API configuration reconciliation
   - Key synchronization verification
   - Usage data backup sync
   - **Impact**: Data drift between BFF and Gateway

2. **Key Lifecycle Jobs** 🟡 MEDIUM
   - Automatic key rotation (every 90 days)
   - Expired key cleanup
   - **Impact**: Security and manual overhead

3. **Usage Aggregation** 🟡 MEDIUM
   - Hourly usage rollups
   - Cost projection calculations
   - **Impact**: Slower analytics queries

4. **Invoice Generation** 🔴 HIGH
   - Auto-generate invoices from closed billing periods
   - **Impact**: Manual invoice creation required

5. **Trial Expiration** 🟡 MEDIUM
   - Detect and suspend expired trials
   - **Impact**: Free usage beyond trial period

---

## 6. Critical Workflow Analysis

### 6.1 API Registration Flow

**Documented Design:**
```
Submit → Two-Phase Commit → Gateway Registration → Rollback on Failure → Success
```

**Current Implementation:**
```
Submit → Create in DB → Gateway Registration → ⚠️ Rollback (delete from DB) → Success
```

**Status**: ✅ **90% Complete**

**What's Working:**
- ✅ Instant activation (no approval)
- ✅ Gateway registration during creation
- ✅ Basic rollback (delete API if gateway fails)

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ Proper transaction management
- ❌ Retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- ❌ Idempotency keys for safety

**Risk Level**: 🟡 MEDIUM
**Why**: Works for most cases, but edge cases (network failures, partial writes) could cause inconsistency

---

### 6.2 Usage Tracking Flow

**Documented Design:**
```
Gateway → Event Queue → BFF → Retry on Failure → Dead Letter Queue → Analytics
```

**Current Implementation:**
```
Gateway → HTTP POST to /usage/events → BFF processes synchronously → Analytics
```

**Status**: ⚠️ **70% Complete**

**What's Working:**
- ✅ Real-time event ingestion
- ✅ Subscription usage updates
- ✅ Analytics storage
- ✅ Batch events from Gateway

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ Async event queue (Bull/Redis)
- ❌ Retry mechanism for failed events
- ❌ Dead letter queue
- ❌ Event deduplication
- ❌ Timestamp validation

**Risk Level**: 🔴 HIGH
**Why**: Event loss = revenue loss. No retry means failed events are lost forever.

---

### 6.3 Key Synchronization

**Documented Design:**
```
BFF Creates Key → Gateway Sync → Verify → Reconciliation Job (daily) → Fix Drift
```

**Current Implementation:**
```
BFF Creates Key → Gateway Sync → ⚠️ Log error on failure → No verification
```

**Status**: ⚠️ **65% Complete**

**What's Working:**
- ✅ Key creation syncs to Gateway
- ✅ Key updates sync to Gateway
- ✅ Key deletion syncs to Gateway

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ Sync verification
- ❌ Retry on Gateway failures
- ❌ Key status: `failed_sync`
- ❌ Reconciliation job to detect drift
- ❌ Automatic healing of mismatches

**Risk Level**: 🟠 MEDIUM-HIGH
**Why**: Keys out of sync = valid subscriptions can't access APIs

---

### 6.4 Subscription Lifecycle

**Documented Design:**
```
Subscribe → Create Billing Period → Generate Keys → Upgrade/Downgrade with Proration → Cancel with Refunds
```

**Current Implementation:**
```
Subscribe → Create Billing Period → Generate Keys → ⚠️ Cancel (no refunds)
```

**Status**: ✅ **75% Complete**

**What's Working:**
- ✅ Subscription creation
- ✅ Billing period management
- ✅ Key generation
- ✅ Usage tracking
- ✅ Quota enforcement
- ✅ Cancellation

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ Subscription upgrade/downgrade
- ❌ Proration calculations
- ❌ Refund processing
- ❌ Trial period support
- ❌ Automatic renewal

**Risk Level**: 🟡 MEDIUM
**Why**: Manual workarounds possible, but poor UX

---

### 6.5 Pricing & Billing

**Documented Design:**
```
YAML Config → DB Sync → Price Calculation → Invoice Generation → Payment Processing
```

**Current Implementation:**
```
YAML Config ✅ → DB Sync ✅ → Price Calculation ✅ → Invoice Generation ⚠️ → Payment Processing ❌
```

**Status**: ⚠️ **70% Complete**

**What's Working:**
- ✅ YAML-based pricing configuration
- ✅ Config validation and hot-reload
- ✅ Tiered pricing models
- ✅ Promotion system
- ✅ Billing periods
- ✅ Price calculation engine
- ✅ Invoice data model

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ Automatic invoice generation (job exists but needs work)
- ❌ Payment gateway integration (Stripe/PayPal)
- ❌ Webhook handlers for payment events
- ❌ Tax calculation
- ❌ Refund processing
- ❌ Dunning management (failed payments)

**Risk Level**: 🔴 HIGH (for production)
**Why**: Can't actually charge customers without payment integration

---

## 7. Integration Points

### 7.1 Gateway (Caddy) Integration

**Status**: ✅ **85% Complete**

**What's Working:**
- ✅ HTTP client for Caddy API
- ✅ API registration/unregistration
- ✅ Key addition/removal
- ✅ Configuration updates

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ Health check endpoint
- ❌ Sync verification
- ❌ Reconciliation jobs
- ❌ Distributed locks for consistency

### 7.2 FusionAuth Integration

**Status**: ⚠️ **40% Complete**

**What's Working:**
- ✅ Service layer exists
- ✅ User registration API calls
- ✅ Basic auth flow

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ Actually running FusionAuth instance
- ❌ JWT validation middleware
- ❌ Token refresh flow
- ❌ OAuth support
- Currently using **hardcoded userId = 1** in routes

### 7.3 Payment Gateway

**Status**: ❌ **0% Complete**

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ Stripe SDK integration
- ❌ Payment intent creation
- ❌ Webhook endpoint
- ❌ Refund processing
- ❌ Subscription billing automation

---

## 8. Testing & Quality

### Unit Tests: ❌ **0% Coverage**

- No test framework configured
- **Action Required**: Set up Jest/Vitest

### Integration Tests: ❌ **0% Coverage**
- No E2E tests
- **Action Required**: Set up Playwright/Supertest

- ❌ Session management

**Risk Level**: 🔴 CRITICAL for production
**Why**: No real authentication = anyone can access anything

### Authorization: ⚠️ **40% Complete**

**What Exists:**
- ✅ Role field in users table
- ✅ Permission checks in services (e.g., "can only delete own APIs")

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ Middleware enforcement
- ❌ Fine-grained permissions
- ❌ Admin panel access control

---

## 10. Monitoring & Observability

### Logging: ⚠️ **50% Complete**
- ✅ Console.log statements throughout
- ❌ No structured logging (JSON)
- ❌ No log aggregation (ELK, Datadog)
- ❌ No correlation IDs

### Metrics: ❌ **0% Complete**
- ❌ No Prometheus metrics
- ❌ No APM (Application Performance Monitoring)
- ❌ No custom business metrics

### Alerting: ❌ **0% Complete**
