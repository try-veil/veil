# **Architectural Patterns for Low-Overhead, Non-Blocking Event Production in Go**

### **Executive Summary**

The challenge of producing side-effect events from a high-performance network proxy without compromising its core function—speed and low resource consumption—requires a careful evaluation of concurrency and communication patterns. The ideal solution must be non-blocking, impose minimal overhead on the proxy, and facilitate a clean separation of concerns, allowing the event consumption logic to evolve independently. This report analyzes three classes of architectural patterns to address this requirement: in-process communication using Go's native concurrency primitives, high-performance Inter-Process Communication (IPC) for co-located processes, and distributed messaging systems for scalable, location-transparent communication.

The analysis concludes that while in-process patterns offer simplicity, they fail to provide the necessary resource isolation. Distributed messaging systems provide powerful features but introduce significant operational overhead. The most effective solutions lie in IPC, which strikes a balance between performance and decoupling.

The primary recommendation is the **Structured Logging to stdout with Vector** pattern. This approach achieves maximum decoupling with the lowest possible overhead on the proxy application by offloading all complexity of reliable delivery, buffering, and transport to a separate, highly-optimized agent. It perfectly aligns with the goal of a simple, "drop-in" proxy that is entirely unaware of its event consumers. For scenarios where absolute raw throughput is the single most critical factor and a tighter coupling is acceptable, **Unix Domain Sockets** are recommended as a high-performance alternative. Finally, **NATS** is identified as the best-in-class distributed messaging system, providing a clear and efficient upgrade path should the architecture need to scale beyond a single host.

## **The Foundation \- In-Process Non-Blocking Communication**

Understanding Go's native, in-process concurrency mechanisms is the essential first step. While these patterns do not ultimately satisfy the requirement for complete process isolation, they establish the fundamental building blocks and reveal the inherent limitations that necessitate more advanced architectures.

### **The Idiomatic "Fire-and-Forget" Send: select with default**

The most fundamental pattern for a non-blocking operation in Go is the select statement combined with a default case. Standard channel sends (ch \<- value) are blocking operations; the sending goroutine will pause until a receiver is ready to accept the data.1 For a high-performance proxy, this blocking behavior is unacceptable as it would stall the processing of network requests.

The select statement allows a goroutine to wait on multiple communication operations. By including a default case, the select statement becomes non-blocking. If no other case (a channel send or receive) is immediately ready, the default case is executed, allowing the goroutine to proceed without delay.1

**Code Implementation:**

Go

package main

import (  
    "fmt"  
    "time"  
)

// fireAndForgetSend attempts to send an event to a channel.  
// If the channel is not ready to receive (e.g., a full buffer),  
// it prints a message and returns immediately, without blocking.  
func fireAndForgetSend(eventChannel chan\<- string, event string) {  
    select {  
    case eventChannel \<- event:  
        // Event sent successfully  
    default:  
        // Channel was not ready, event is dropped.  
        fmt.Println("Event dropped, consumer is not ready:", event)  
    }  
}

func main() {  
    // An unbuffered channel with no active receiver.  
    // Any send will require the default case to be non-blocking.  
    eventChannel := make(chan string)

    fireAndForgetSend(eventChannel, "critical\_event\_1")

    // A buffered channel with a capacity of 1\.  
    bufferedChannel := make(chan string, 1)

    // First send will succeed and fill the buffer.  
    fireAndForgetSend(bufferedChannel, "buffered\_event\_1")

    // Second send will fail as the buffer is full.  
    fireAndForgetSend(bufferedChannel, "buffered\_event\_2")  
}

This pattern is a direct reflection of Go's core philosophy. Unlike languages with implicit event loops that hide I/O blocking, Go's concurrency model makes blocking explicit. The select-default pattern forces the developer to make a conscious decision about how to handle a situation where the consumer cannot keep up: in this case, by dropping the event.4 This is an implicit load-shedding mechanism, providing "at-most-once" delivery semantics by default.

### **Absorbing Bursts: The Role of Buffered Channels**

To mitigate transient load spikes where the producer temporarily outpaces the consumer, a buffered channel can be used. A buffered channel acts as a small, in-memory FIFO queue, allowing the sender to enqueue a limited number of items without a receiver being immediately available.6 This temporarily decouples the producer and consumer, making the system more resilient to short-lived consumer slowdowns.

The size of the buffer is a critical tuning parameter. A larger buffer can absorb more significant traffic bursts but increases the application's memory footprint. If the consumer falls significantly behind, events in the buffer can become stale. A small buffer is memory-efficient but offers less protection against consumer latency spikes.6

However, a buffered channel is not a complete solution for a persistently slow consumer. Once the buffer is full, the channel behaves like an unbuffered channel, and any subsequent non-blocking send attempt via select-default will result in the event being dropped. This underscores the reality that within a single process, producer and consumer performance are inevitably coupled.

### **The In-Process Consumer: The Worker Pool Pattern**

The standard consumer for a channel-based workload in Go is the worker pool. This pattern involves launching a fixed number of long-lived worker goroutines that all read from a single, shared jobs channel.8 This approach provides controlled parallelism, preventing the unbounded creation of goroutines that can lead to memory exhaustion, high garbage collection (GC) pressure, and excessive scheduler contention.9

Performance tuning for a worker pool depends heavily on the nature of the work being performed:

* **CPU-Bound Tasks:** For tasks that are computationally intensive (e.g., hashing, serialization), the optimal number of workers is typically close to the number of available CPU cores, which can be queried with runtime.NumCPU(). Exceeding this number leads to diminishing returns as goroutines compete for CPU time, causing excessive context switching and reduced cache locality.9  
* **I/O-Bound Tasks:** For tasks that spend most of their time waiting for external resources (e.g., database queries, network API calls), the number of workers can be significantly higher than the number of CPU cores. While one worker is blocked on I/O, the Go scheduler can run another, improving overall throughput.9

Despite its efficiency, the in-process worker pool has a fundamental flaw for the proxy use case: it does not provide true resource isolation. The proxy and the worker pool share the same process space, memory heap, and Go scheduler. A CPU-intensive task in a worker can steal CPU cycles from the proxy's core request-handling goroutines. A memory leak or a large allocation in the workers can trigger a GC pause that stops the entire application, including the proxy's network listeners, directly increasing request latency.9 This illusion of isolation—where components are logically decoupled by channels but physically coupled by the process—is the primary driver for adopting a multi-process architecture.

## **Decoupling Processes \- High-Performance IPC on a Single Host**

To achieve true resource isolation, the event consumer must be moved to a separate process. This section analyzes two powerful, low-overhead Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanisms well-suited for communication between a high-performance proxy and a co-located consumer.

### **The High-Speed Channel: Unix Domain Sockets (UDS)**

For communication between processes on the same host, Unix Domain Sockets (UDS) are a superior alternative to TCP loopback connections. UDS operates as a file-system-based IPC mechanism, communicating entirely within the OS kernel. This approach bypasses the entire network stack, avoiding the overhead of TCP/IP protocols, including connection handshakes, checksum calculations, and routing logic.13

The performance benefits are substantial. Benchmarks consistently show that UDS offers significantly lower latency and higher throughput.

| Metric | Unix Domain Socket (UDS) | TCP Loopback | Performance Delta |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Average Latency** | 2 µs | 6 µs | \~67% lower latency |
| **Throughput** | \~1.73M messages/sec | \~0.25M messages/sec | \~7x higher throughput |
| **Kernel Operations** | Fewer context switches, direct data copy | Full network stack traversal | Lighter kernel overhead |
| **Security Model** | Filesystem permissions (user/group) | Network port (firewall rules) | More granular, local control |

Data compiled from benchmarks presented in.16

Real-world applications like Redis and PostgreSQL have demonstrated performance gains of 30-50% by using UDS over TCP for local connections.16 In Go, UDS is natively supported via the

net package by specifying the "unix" network type, making implementation straightforward.13

Furthermore, UDS provides a more robust security model. Since a socket is a filesystem object, access can be restricted using standard Unix file permissions, limiting communication to specific users or groups on the system. This is inherently more secure than opening a TCP port, even if it is bound only to localhost.13

The primary trade-off with UDS is the tight coupling of the data format. The producer (proxy) and consumer must agree on a specific serialization protocol (e.g., JSON, Protocol Buffers). Any change to the event schema requires a coordinated deployment of both processes.

### **The Ultimate Decoupling: Structured Logging as IPC**

An alternative and highly flexible IPC pattern involves treating the standard output (stdout) stream as a high-throughput, unidirectional communication channel. In this model, the proxy's sole responsibility is to write structured, machine-readable log lines in a format like JSON to stdout. A separate, specialized agent process—a log shipper—is then responsible for reading this stream, parsing it, and forwarding the events to their final destination.19

Producer Implementation (slog):  
Go's standard library now includes the log/slog package, a high-performance, structured logging library that has become the idiomatic choice for new projects.21 Writing to  
stdout is a highly optimized and buffered operation within the operating system. Using slog with a JSONHandler allows the proxy to generate events with minimal overhead.

Go

// Go Proxy using slog to write events to stdout  
package main

import (  
    "log/slog"  
    "os"  
)

var eventLogger \= slog.New(slog.NewJSONHandler(os.Stdout, nil))

func handleRequest(userID string, requestPath string) {  
    // The proxy's only responsibility is to write a structured log line.  
    eventLogger.Info("user\_activity",  
        slog.String("event\_type", "page\_view"),  
        slog.String("user\_id", userID),  
        slog.String("path", requestPath),  
    )  
}

Consumer Implementation (Vector):  
For the consumer side, a modern, high-performance agent is required. Vector, a log shipper written in Rust, is designed for efficiency and reliability. Benchmarks show it consistently outperforms older alternatives like Fluentd, using significantly less CPU and memory to handle the same workload, which is critical for maintaining a lightweight overall system footprint.23

| Metric | Vector (Rust) | Fluentd (Ruby) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **CPU Usage** | Significantly lower | Higher |
| **Memory Footprint (RSS)** | Lower and more stable | Higher, subject to GC pauses |
| **Throughput per Core** | Higher | Lower |
| **Reliability** | Consistent buffering/backpressure | Varies by plugin |
| **Configuration** | Simple, unified (TOML/YAML) | Complex, plugin-specific |

Data compiled from performance comparisons in.23

A simple Vector configuration can tail the proxy's output, parse the JSON, and forward it reliably.

Ini, TOML

\# vector.toml \- Consumer configuration  
\[sources.proxy\_events\]  
  type \= "stdin" \# Or "file" if stdout is redirected

\[transforms.parse\_proxy\_json\]  
  type \= "remap"  
  inputs \= \["proxy\_events"\]  
  source \= '''  
. \= parse\_json\!(.message)  
  '''

\[sinks.upstream\_api\]  
  type \= "http"  
  inputs \= \["parse\_proxy\_json"\]  
  uri \= "https://api.upstream.service/events"  
  batch.max\_events \= 100  
  batch.timeout\_secs \= 5

This pattern offers several profound advantages:

* **Extreme Decoupling:** The proxy has zero knowledge of the consumer. It simply adheres to the universal contract of writing to stdout. The consumer technology can be swapped out (e.g., from Vector to Fluentd or even a simple shell script) with no changes to the proxy application.27 This perfectly achieves the desired "drop-in" nature.  
* **Resilience:** The responsibility for reliable delivery—including buffering (both in-memory and on-disk), retries with backoff, and backpressure—is shifted entirely to the specialized agent. This keeps the proxy's logic simple and focused on its primary task.  
* **Observability as a By-product:** The event stream is simultaneously a human-readable and machine-parsable log stream, simplifying debugging, monitoring, and ad-hoc analysis.

The choice between UDS and structured logging is a trade-off between raw performance and architectural flexibility. UDS offers the absolute lowest-latency communication path but creates a tight, point-to-point coupling. The logging pattern introduces a marginal amount of latency but provides immense architectural freedom. For most systems, this flexibility is worth the small performance trade-off. Furthermore, separating processes introduces new operational complexities, such as lifecycle management and deployment coordination. Using a mature, battle-tested tool like Vector mitigates much of this new complexity on the consumer side.

## **Scaling Out \- Distributed Messaging Systems**

When the consumer must reside on a different host, or when advanced features like persistence and guaranteed delivery are required, a distributed messaging system becomes necessary. This step introduces greater architectural complexity and operational overhead but provides location transparency and enhanced reliability.

### **When to Graduate to a Messaging System**

The move from local IPC to a full-fledged messaging system is typically driven by one or more of the following requirements:

* **Location Transparency:** The consumer process needs to run on a different machine from the producer.  
* **Durability and Persistence:** Events must be stored on disk and survive restarts of both the proxy and the consumer.  
* **Advanced Routing:** The system requires patterns like fan-out (one message to multiple consumers), topic-based filtering, or load balancing across a fleet of consumers.  
* **Guaranteed Delivery:** Dropping events is unacceptable, necessitating robust acknowledgment mechanisms to ensure messages are processed at least once.

### **Comparative Analysis: NATS vs. Kafka vs. RabbitMQ**

From the perspective of a lightweight proxy, the choice of messaging system hinges on client-side performance, resource footprint, and operational simplicity.

| Feature | NATS | Kafka | RabbitMQ |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **P99 Latency** | **0.5-2ms** (in-memory) | 15-25ms (persistent) | 5-15ms (hybrid) |
| **Throughput (Fire-and-Forget)** | **\~8M msgs/sec** | \~2.1M msgs/sec | \~80K msgs/sec |
| **Throughput (Persistent)** | \~1.2M msgs/sec (JetStream) | **\~2.1M msgs/sec** | \~25K msgs/sec |
| **Go Client Non-Blocking API** | Purest fire-and-forget | Async with separate event chan | Async with separate confirm chan |
| **Operational Complexity** | **Low** (self-healing mesh) | High (requires Zookeeper/KRaft) | Moderate |
| **Primary Use Case** | High-performance messaging | Durable event streaming | Complex, flexible routing |

Data compiled from benchmarks and analysis in.28

* **NATS:** Stands out as the performance and simplicity leader. It offers extremely high throughput and the lowest latency, with a simple, lightweight Go client. Its "at-most-once" core is ideal for fire-and-forget scenarios, while the optional JetStream layer adds persistence and "at-least-once" guarantees without burdening the core system.28 Its operational simplicity makes it highly aligned with the goal of a lightweight system.30  
* **Kafka:** Is a powerful platform for durable, high-throughput event streaming. However, this power comes at the cost of higher latency and significant operational complexity.30 Its architecture is better suited for building large-scale data pipelines than for low-latency side-effect events from a proxy.  
* **RabbitMQ:** Is a feature-rich, mature message broker that excels at complex routing scenarios. Its performance is generally lower than NATS and Kafka, and it follows a "smart broker, dumb client" philosophy, where routing logic resides in the broker configuration.30

The choice of system imposes its architectural philosophy on the application. NATS's focus on simplicity and performance imposes the least cognitive and operational overhead, making it the best fit for extending a lightweight proxy into a distributed environment.

### **Go Client Deep Dive: Non-Blocking Publish APIs**

While all three systems offer a non-blocking *send*, the mechanism for handling the *result* of that send (i.e., delivery confirmation) differs significantly, impacting the complexity within the proxy application.

* **NATS (nats.go):** The nc.Publish() call is a non-blocking, fire-and-forget operation where the client buffers messages and sends them asynchronously.32 For the lowest possible overhead, the  
  ec.BindSendChan() method allows the proxy to simply send an event to a standard Go channel, completely abstracting the publishing logic into the NATS client's background routines.33 For guaranteed delivery with JetStream,  
  js.PublishAsync() returns a future that can be handled separately, keeping the publish call itself non-blocking.28  
* **Kafka (confluent-kafka-go):** The p.Produce() method is asynchronous, placing the message in an internal buffer and returning immediately. However, delivery status (success or failure) is reported on a separate Go channel obtained from p.Events(). This requires the proxy application to spawn and manage a dedicated goroutine to consume these delivery reports.34  
* **RabbitMQ (rabbitmq/amqp091-go):** To achieve reliable delivery, the channel must be placed in "confirm mode." The broker then sends asynchronous acknowledgments. The client application must use Channel.NotifyPublish to receive these confirmations on a dedicated Go channel, separating the act of publishing from the act of confirmation.36

The NATS client library, particularly with BindSendChan, provides the most idiomatic and lowest-overhead abstraction for the proxy's hot path, requiring the least amount of application-level code to manage the asynchronous communication.

## **Applying IPC Patterns: A Practical Use Case for Decoupled Event Emission**

The architectural patterns discussed can be applied to solve the common challenge of emitting events from a high-performance proxy to a stream processor (like Kafka or RabbitMQ) without degrading the proxy's performance. The optimal strategy is to decouple the event production (the "hot path") from the reliable delivery mechanism (the "cold path") by introducing an intermediate, lightweight store and a separate shipper process. This isolates the proxy from any latency or failures in the upstream messaging system.

### **Recommended Pattern: Structured Logging as an IPC Stream**

This approach offers the best balance of performance, reliability, and extreme decoupling. The proxy's only responsibility is to write a structured log line to its standard output (stdout), which is a fast, buffered, and non-blocking operation at the OS level.

1\. The Proxy (The "Dumper")  
Your Go proxy uses the standard library's log/slog package to write events as JSON lines.10 The proxy has zero awareness of the final destination, achieving perfect isolation.

Go

// In your proxy application  
import (  
    "log/slog"  
    "os"  
)

// This logger becomes your event emitter. It's configured once.  
var eventLogger \= slog.New(slog.NewJSONHandler(os.Stdout, nil))

func handleProxyRequest(/\*...\*/) {  
    //... core proxy logic...

    // This is the "dump" operation. It's a non-blocking, fire-and-forget write.  
    eventLogger.Info("user\_event",  
        slog.String("event\_type", "login\_success"),  
        slog.String("user\_id", "user-123"),  
    )

    //... continue serving the request without delay...  
}

2\. The Intermediate Store (The OS Pipe)  
A standard Unix pipe (|) connects the proxy's stdout to the shipper's stdin, creating a highly efficient, in-memory buffer managed by the operating system.  
./proxy |./event-shipper

3\. The Separate Process (The Shipper)  
A high-performance agent like Vector is ideal for this role. Written in Rust, Vector uses significantly less CPU and memory than alternatives like Fluentd.22 It handles buffering (in-memory and on-disk), batching, and reliable forwarding to your stream processor with retries and backpressure.  
A simple vector.toml configuration to ship events to Kafka:

Ini, TOML

\# vector.toml \- Configuration for the event-shipper process

\# 1\. Read events from the proxy's stdout  
\[sources.proxy\_events\]  
  type \= "stdin"

\# 2\. Parse the JSON events  
\[transforms.parse\_json\]  
  type \= "remap"  
  inputs \= \["proxy\_events"\]  
  source \= '. \= parse\_json\!(.message)'

\# 3\. Send to your stream processor (e.g., Kafka)  
\[sinks.kafka\_upstream\]  
  type \= "kafka"  
  inputs \= \["parse\_json"\]  
  bootstrap\_servers \= "kafka-broker-1:9092"  
  topic \= "proxy-events"  
  \# Vector handles batching, compression, and retries automatically

### **Alternative Pattern: Maximum Performance with Unix Domain Sockets**

For the absolute lowest possible latency between co-located processes, a Unix Domain Socket (UDS) is a strong alternative. UDS bypasses the network stack entirely, offering higher throughput than TCP loopback connections.

* **The Proxy (The "Dumper"):** The proxy acts as a client, performing a non-blocking write to a UDS file (e.g., /tmp/proxy.sock).  
* **The Shipper Process:** A custom Go application listens on the UDS, reads events, and uses a buffered channel and worker pool to forward them to the upstream stream processor.

While this pattern offers the highest IPC performance, it requires writing and maintaining the shipper process and creates a tighter coupling on the data format and socket path.

### **Connecting the Shipper to the Stream Processor**

In both patterns, the shipper process is responsible for the final, potentially blocking, communication with the stream processor. This is where non-blocking client libraries are essential:

* **For Kafka:** The confluent-kafka-go client's Produce() method is non-blocking. It buffers the message and returns immediately, with delivery status reported asynchronously on a separate Events() channel.  
* **For RabbitMQ:** The rabbitmq/amqp091-go library's "publisher confirms" mode, enabled via Channel.Confirm, provides asynchronous acknowledgements on a channel obtained from NotifyPublish.37

This design completely shields the proxy from the complexities and potential latency of these network protocols, ensuring its performance remains high and predictable.

## **Synthesis and Final Recommendations**

The analysis of in-process, IPC, and distributed patterns reveals a clear path for selecting the optimal architecture based on specific constraints. The final recommendations prioritize minimizing overhead on the proxy and maximizing architectural decoupling.

### **Decision Framework: Choosing the Right Pattern**

A simple decision tree can guide the selection process:

1. **Is strict process isolation (separate CPU, memory, GC) an absolute requirement?**  
   * **No:** The **In-Process Buffered Channel with a Worker Pool** is the simplest solution. However, be aware of the inherent risk of resource contention impacting proxy performance.  
   * **Yes:** Proceed to question 2\.  
2. **Will the event producer (proxy) and consumer *always* reside on the same host?**  
   * **No / Maybe in the future:** Choose a distributed messaging system. **NATS** is the recommended choice due to its superior performance, low-latency profile, and operational simplicity.  
   * **Yes:** Proceed to question 3\.  
3. **What is the single most important optimization goal?**  
   * **Ultimate Decoupling and Operational Simplicity:** If the ability to modify or replace the consumer with zero impact on the proxy is the top priority, choose the **Structured Logging to stdout \+ Vector** pattern.  
   * **Raw IPC Throughput:** If minimizing every microsecond of latency is paramount and a tightly coupled data contract between producer and consumer is acceptable, choose **Unix Domain Sockets**.

### **Primary Recommendation: Blueprint for Structured Logging IPC**

This pattern is recommended as the best overall solution, perfectly balancing performance, decoupling, and operational simplicity.

**Architectural Diagram:**

\+----------------+      \+--------+      \+-----------------+      \+------------------+      \+------------------+

| HTTP Client | \<--\> | Go Proxy | \--\>\> | stdout | \--\>\> | Vector Process | \--\>\> | Upstream Service |  
| | | (slog) | | (JSON stream) | | (Buffer, Retry) | | (HTTP/gRPC) |  
\+----------------+      \+--------+      \+-----------------+      \+------------------+      \+------------------+

Proxy Implementation (Go):  
Set up a global logger instance configured to write JSON to standard output. Within the proxy's request handlers, emit events as structured log messages.

Go

package main

import (  
    "log/slog"  
    "net/http"  
    "os"  
)

// Configure a global logger for events.  
var eventLogger \= slog.New(slog.NewJSONHandler(os.Stdout, nil))

func proxyHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r \*http.Request) {  
    //... proxy logic...

    // Fire-and-forget event production.  
    eventLogger.Info("api\_request\_completed",  
        slog.String("method", r.Method),  
        slog.String("path", r.URL.Path),  
        slog.Int("status\_code", http.StatusOK),  
    )

    w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)  
    w.Write(byte("OK"))  
}

Consumer Implementation (Vector):  
Deploy Vector as a sidecar to the proxy. The configuration below reads from stdin, parses the JSON, and forwards it to an upstream HTTP endpoint with batching and retries.

Ini, TOML

\# /etc/vector/vector.toml

\[sources.proxy\_stdout\]  
  type \= "stdin"  
  \# For production, you might redirect proxy stdout to a file and use:  
  \# type \= "file"  
  \# include \= \["/var/log/proxy/events.log"\]

\[transforms.parse\_events\]  
  type \= "remap"  
  inputs \= \["proxy\_stdout"\]  
  source \= '. \= parse\_json\!(.message)'

\[sinks.upstream\]  
  type \= "http"  
  inputs \= \["parse\_events"\]  
  uri \= "https://api.example.com/v1/events"  
  method \= "post"  
  batch.max\_events \= 200  
  batch.timeout\_secs \= 10  
  request.timeout\_secs \= 30

This architecture completely isolates the proxy from the consumer. The proxy's only dependency is the Go standard library, and its performance is dictated by the highly optimized process of writing to a buffered OS pipe.

### **Secondary Recommendation: Blueprint for Unix Domain Sockets**

For use cases demanding the absolute lowest latency, UDS is the optimal choice.

**Architectural Diagram:**

\+----------------+      \+--------+      \+------------------+      \+-------------+

| HTTP Client | \<--\> | Go Proxy | \--\>\> | /tmp/proxy.sock | \--\>\> | Go Consumer |  
| | | (Client) | | (UDS Filesystem) | | (Server) |  
\+----------------+      \+--------+      \+------------------+      \+-------------+

This requires a shared internal package defining the event structure and a standalone Go application for the consumer that listens on the socket file. The proxy acts as the client, dialing the socket to send serialized event data. While exceptionally fast, this pattern creates a direct dependency between the two processes on the data format and the socket's availability.

### **Future-Proofing and Final Conclusion**

The primary recommendation of Structured Logging IPC is not only powerful for same-host communication but also remarkably future-proof. If the system architecture evolves to require a distributed, multi-node deployment, the migration path is seamless. The Vector sink configuration can be changed from an http sink to a nats sink with minimal effort. **Crucially, this change requires zero modifications to the proxy application code.** The proxy continues to write events to stdout, completely unaware that its events are now being routed through a global messaging fabric.

In conclusion, for building a lightweight, high-performance Go proxy that needs to produce side-effect events, the most robust, maintainable, and decoupled architecture is to offload the complexity of asynchronous communication to a specialized sidecar process. By treating structured logs as a high-performance IPC stream and leveraging a tool like Vector, the proxy remains simple, fast, and entirely isolated from the concerns of event consumption, achieving the ideal of a truly independent component.
